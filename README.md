# AutoSAM
AutoSAM: Adapting SAM to Medical Images by Overloading the Prompt Encoder

## Overview

This work improves the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical image segmentation by replacing its conditioning mechanism with an image-based encoder. Without further fine-tuning SAM, this modification achieves state-of-the-art results on medical images and video benchmarks.
